# ManagedBass.FftSignalProvider
A library to use [ManagedBass](https://github.com/ManagedBass/ManagedBass) to read playback or microphone data with FFT windowing functions.

## Setting it up
The software requires [BASS](http://www.un4seen.com) libraries as they are not allowed the be distributed in embeded form. The sample application also contains the libraries.
